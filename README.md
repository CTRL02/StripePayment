# Stripe Payment Integration

This repository demonstrates a simple integration of **Stripe** for processing payments. The flow includes frontend card collection using Stripe Elements, backend creation of a PaymentIntent, webhook handling, and testing the webhook with Stripe CLI.

## Flow Overview

1. **Frontend:**
    - The frontend uses **Stripe Elements** to collect the customer’s payment details securely.
    - The frontend collects the customer’s email and total price for the payment, and uses Stripe Elements to create a `PaymentMethod` ID.
    - The `PaymentMethod` ID, along with the email and total price, is sent to the backend.

2. **Backend:**
    - The backend receives the `PaymentMethod` ID, customer email, and total price, and uses the Stripe API to create a **PaymentIntent**.
    - The `PaymentIntent` is created with the `PaymentMethod` and `amount` to initiate the charge.
    - The `PaymentIntent` returns a **clientSecret** which the frontend uses to confirm the payment.
    - The backend also sets up a **Webhook** endpoint to listen for Stripe events like payment success or failure.

3. **Webhook:**
    - A webhook endpoint on the backend listens for events sent by Stripe (like `payment_intent.succeeded`, `payment_intent.payment_failed`).
    - Based on the event type, appropriate actions are taken (e.g., sending a success notification or refunding the payment).
    - To test your webhook, you can use Stripe CLI to simulate Stripe events.

**Security**:
   -It is recommended not to accept full price from frontend but instead check order details saved in the database and charge the customer accordingly to avoid false 
        information from frontside.
